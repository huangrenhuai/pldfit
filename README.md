# Protein-Ligand Biosensor Data Fitting in R
-----
There are two popular biosensor techniques:  
* Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) 
* Surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  

Model to be developed in the package:  
* Simple one to one binding
  + steady state 
  + kinetic 
* Dimerization model:  
  + steady state 
  + kinetic 
* Multiple binding sites 
  + steady state 
  + kinetic 
* Others
