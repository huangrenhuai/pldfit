# Kinetic Fitting of Protein-Ligand Biosensor Data

Biosensor data fiting. 
There are two popular biosensor techniques, Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  

The purpose of the package is to develop a interface to 

First I working using dimerization model including both steady state and kinetic fitting. Then I will working on model with multiple binding sites.
